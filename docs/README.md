> ⚠️ This library is not yet compatible with imports with script tag.

### npm

```
npm i dev-timer
```

NodeJS usage
```js
const { Timer } = require("dev-timer");
```

### ESM

Dev Timer can be imported as ES modules for browsers that support it. The specifics differ depending on the CDN, but here's a pattern for including the ES module where supported, and falling back to a UMD version for older browsers.

HTML5
```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

JS ( index.js )
```js
import { Timer } from "https://unpkg.com/dev-timer@0.3.0/ES/Timer.js";
```

## Usage

You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/BOT-maKeR-0000/dev-timer/wiki).
To find more examples, please refer to [examples folder](https://github.com/BOT-maKeR-0000/dev-timer/tree/main/examples) or [step by step examples](https://github.com/BOT-maKeR-0000/dev-timer/wiki/examples).

### Basic Example :

```js
const { Timer } = require('dev-timer');

// Create a new timer instance with a 15 seconds duration
const timer = new Timer(15000); 

timer.start(); // Start the timer

// Add a callback to be called when the timer ends
timer.onEnd = ()=>{
    console.log('Timer ended');
}
```

## Credits

This project was mainly created by me... so... But I would like to thank [Patafix](https://github.com/PatafixPLTX) who helped me to create this README.

But this project was only possible thanks to TypeScript, Javascript, npm and Github <3
